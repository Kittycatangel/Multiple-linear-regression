# Multiple-linear-regression


linear regression is one of the simplest algorithms that you can apply to a dataset to model the relationships between features and labels.
Let’s explore Boston data set .

RM (“average number of rooms per dwelling”) and LSTAT (“% of lower status of the population”) affect the price of housing in Boston.

This means that as LSTAT (“% of lower status of the population”) increases, the prices of houses go down. When LSTAT decreases, the prices go up. Similarly, as RM (“average number of rooms per dwelling”) increases, so will the price. And when RM goes down, the prices go down as well.


Build a multiple linear regression based on two features: RM & LSTAT to predic the price of houses wth R- squared of 0.6162 and mean squred error of 36.4.
